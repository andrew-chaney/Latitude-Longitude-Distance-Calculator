# Latitude-Longitude-Distance-Calculator

This program acts as a distance calculator that takes two coordinates (as latitude and longitude) as input and outputs the distance between them in either miles or kilometers. The distance is calculated using the Haversine Formula. The input of the latitude and longitude coordinates are in degree-minute-decimal format for easier reading, and as it is one of the standards across the maritime navigation industry. 

Written in Rust, this is only the two files from the src/ folder, I would recommend creating a new project with cargo and then putting the included files into the src/ folder and compiling with "cargo build" or just running it with "cargo run".
